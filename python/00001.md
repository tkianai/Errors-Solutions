# Two ways to update python version

**One thing you must know: while you have updated your python, you need re-install the third packages from scratch.**


- Update system python

1. Download the needed (or latest stable) verison pre-built binary from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release)
2. Install the binary by double-click it
3. Update the soft link for `python` and `pip`, for example:

```sh
# mac
# when you have installed the higher version of python
which python # record this path: /usr/local/bin/python (probabely)
sudo rm -rf <soft link> # using last soft link path
# on mac system, the newer python would be installed at `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin`
sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python

# remember to update the pip 
which pip
sudo rm -rf <soft link>
sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/pip3 /usr/local/bin/pip
```


- ~~Update conda python~~

1. using the command: `conda update python`, update python to latest stable version. **conda cracked**
